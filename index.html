			<h2>Ways to stay protected online</h2>
			<p>Personal data refers to any information about a living person who can be identified. Personal data is made up of several pieces of information that, when put together, can be used to identify a specific person.</p>
		</div>

	<div class="container">
		<div class="Innercont1">
			<h3>Pick strong, unique passwords</h3>
			<p>Pick strong passwords mixing capitalized letters, numbers, and symbols, and vary your codes as much as possible.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="Innercont2">
			<h3>Use a VPN</h3>
			<p>These tools encrypt data that leaves your computer and route it via third-party servers which scramble your identity.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="Innercont3">
			<h3>Use two-factor authentication</h3>
			<p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a way of confirming your identity by using two of these three factors - something you have, something you know, and something you are.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="Innercont4">
			<h3>Be careful what you share online</h3>
			<p>To keep your social network activity more private, go to settings, and make it available to your friends or followers only. Also make sure you don't have location sharing turned on all the time.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="Innercont5">
			<h3>Update AV software</h3>
			<p>Trojan horses and worms can infect your computer and feed whatever you type straight to the hands of criminals. Much of the time, you can avoid this kind of infection by keeping anti-malware software up to date.</p>
